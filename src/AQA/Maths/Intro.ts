        <p>Maths is for everyone. It is diverse, engaging and essential in equipping students with the right skills to reach their future destination, whatever that may be. At AQA, we design qualifications and support to enable students to engage with, explore, enjoy and succeed in maths. By putting students at the heart of everything we do, our aim is to support teachers to shape what success in maths looks like for every student.</p>
        <p>Our question papers are designed with students in mind. We’re committed to ensuring that students are settled early in our exams and have the best possible opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of maths, to ensure they achieve the results they deserve.</p>
